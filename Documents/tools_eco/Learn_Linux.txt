1. Understand Linux password manager with pass (the standard linux password manager
username & email for password manager is : roshan && xavier.roshan@gmail.com
username for docker desktop is google authentication

Very important tips: 



1. please note that in VM installed in a KVM mouse will not work unless gpm (general purpose mouse is installed
Steps below::
so if you’re running the VM in a text-only (TTY) mode without a graphical desktop, the mouse won’t work by default because TTY interfaces don’t support mouse input unless you’re using a tool like gpm (General Purpose Mouse).
Steps:
Install gpm in the VM: sudo apt install gpm
Start the gpm service: sudo systemctl start gpm


2. MySQL port forwarding

I have mapped port 3307 (usually it is 3306, but I have used 3307) on my local machine to 3306 of the pod with mysql server. So i need to use this connection to connect to pod from local machine

roshan@roshan:/opt/custom_config$ kubectl port-forward pod/mysql-0 3307:3306
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3307 -> 3306
Forwarding from [::1]:3307 -> 3306
Handling connection for 3307

Command to access mysql in kubernetes from local machine: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u roshan -p

3. Kafka port forwarding
roshan@roshan:/opt/custom_config$ kubectl port-forward kafka-controller-0 9092:9092
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9092 -> 9092
Forwarding from [::1]:9092 -> 9092


4. Starting the k3s cluster: sudo systemctl start k3s
5. sudo kubectl get pod
6. sudo kubectl get svc
7. mysql -h <ip of mysql service> u roshan -p



Softwares to be removed

virtualbox
kvm qemu
k3c
mysql
java
