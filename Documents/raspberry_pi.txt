Steps to install raspberry Pi

1. Insert the sd card and wipe it clean

a. lsblk -> find the drive and partition. On my machine it was showing up as dev/sda and had three partitions sda1,sda2 and sda3
b. umount sda1, umount sda2, and umount sda3 -> unmount all the partitions
c. sudo fsdisk dev/sda -> to launch the utility to manage the disk
d. delete all partitions and created a new partition
   Press d (delete partitions) until no partitions remain.
   Press n (new partition), choose primary, default sizes.
   Press w (write changes).
e. By default the partition format is 83 Linux; need to chnage this to FAT32 (W95 FAT32 (LBA)
   Press t → Change partition type.
   Press b → Select W95 FAT32 (LBA).
   Press p → Verify that the partition type has changed to b W95 FAT32 (LBA).
   Press w → Write changes and exit.
f. sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1  -> format the partition as FAT32
